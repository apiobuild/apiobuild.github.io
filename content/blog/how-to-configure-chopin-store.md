## Update Catalog Sheet

Fields are defined as the following:

- product_url *(optional)*: Link to an external web page, like a facebook post or blog review.
- image_url: URL of the product image or YouTube video link (obtained via Share button). Multiple image urls can be separated by commas (,). [*What\'s image url?](https://apiobuild.com/blog/troubleshoot-chopin-store/#how-can-i-obtain-image-url)
- price: Product price, no need to enter "$" (dollar sign).
- max_qty: Maximum quantity that *one customer* can buy. If max_qty = 0, it will show 'Coming Soon'
- category *(optional)*: To allow customer to filter products. Multiple categories can be separated by commas (,).
