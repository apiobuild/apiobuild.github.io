## Update Catalog Sheet

Your store would be look like [this](https://chopin.apiobuild.com/google-oauth2%7C106308532747537725517/3b99cc9c-6c28-45dd-9786-8521fe0a2e47) if you follow the [tutorial](https://apiobuild.com/blog/how-to-create-web-store-with-apio) and use the example data provided. But I'm pretty sure you're not selling Cool Cat and Funny Cat. Now it's time to update the catalog google sheet with your own product information.

Fields are defined as the following:

- name: Unique name/id starts with any alphabet and contains **only dashes (-), underscores (_), and alphanumeric are allowed** for each product. No spaces.
- nickname: Item names that will appear on the store page, they can be **any language, symbol, and even emoji**.
- description *(optional)*: More information about the product. [*Styling with Markdown is supported](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
- image_url: URL of the product image(s). Multiple image urls can be separated by commas (,). [*What\'s image url?](https://apiobuild.com/blog/troubleshoot-chopin-store/#how-can-i-obtain-image-url)
- price: Product price, no need to enter "$" (dollar sign).
- max_qty *(optional)*: Maximum quantity that *one customer* can buy. If max_qty = 0, it will show 'Coming Soon'
- category *(optional)*: To allow customer to filter products. Multiple categories can be separated by commas (,).
- hide: Enter "x" (or any other characters), this product will not appear on your store.
- no_tax: Enter "x" (or any other characters), sales tax won't apply to this product.

Example:
<img src="/images/blog/catalog_sheet_ex1.png" class="post-img">

<br>

If you want to [sell products with multiple options](https://apiobuild.com/blog/how-to-add-options-to-products/), you will need to add below columns manually:

- option:name
- option:size
- option:flavor
- option:color

Example:
<img src="/images/blog/catalog_sheet_ex2.png" class="post-img">

‚ö†Ô∏è Important:
1. There should not be any empty line(s) between rows.
2. Only items with valid `name` and `price` will show on website.

If you experience any errors, [follow these FAQs and troubleshoot yourself](https://apiobuild.com/blog/troubleshoot-chopin-store/) or [contact customer support](https://m.me/apiobuild)!

## Configure Your Store (in Chopin app)

The next step is to customize your store in [Chopin](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/chopin) app, where you can change the layout of your online store or configure various functions. You can update this information anytime (except store name and waitress APIs) and the updates will be reflected in real-time.

‚ö†Ô∏è Editing Tips:
- Click <i class="fas fa-save"></i> (save sign) to save your updates. Click <i class="fas fa-trash-alt"></i> (trash can sign) to delete the store completely.
- Click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> (plus sign) to add new information and click <i class="fas fa-minus"></i> (minus sign) to delete the information.
- To modify, just select the same option and enter with the updated information. Then click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> (plus sign) to update.

If you didn't grant us access to send email on your behalf when [creating store](https://apiobuild.com/blog/how-to-create-web-store-with-apio/#step-4-add-email-confirmation), you can do so in [Post-it app](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/post-it/).

   üì´ [What does the confirmation email look like?](https://apiobuild.com/blog/introducing-post-it-email-automation-service/#email-template)

- *`[NEW]`* Order Confirmation Email Subject: Customize the subject of order confirmation email. Use `<store_name>` and `<order_number>` to show the name of your store and the customer's order number.

### Payment Methods

Each payment method will appear as a **button**. If you don't add any payment options, there will be a **"Submit Order"** button. You can enable as many payment options as you'd like. They will replace the "Submit Order" button.

Visit our [Demo Store](https://chopin.apiobuild.com/demo-store) and see how they work in real world. If you don't see your preferred payment methods, [drop us a message](https://apiobuild.com/forms/business/)!

<img src="/images/blog/e_payment_button_21.png" class="post-img">

#### Online Payment Processor

We currently support [Stripe](https://stripe.com/payments) as online payment processor, which allows your customers pay with credit cards. [Contact us](https://apiobuild.com/forms/business/) when you've signed up Stripe and are ready to integrate them to your Chopin store.

There is a processing fee of **2.9% + 30¬¢**, that will be deducted directly from your Stripe account. apio doesn't take a cut from your profits! Click links below for more detailed pricing. [*Stripe v.s PayPal. Which one is better?](https://apiobuild.com/blog/troubleshoot-chopin-store/#difference-between-stripe-and-paypal-business)

- *`[NEW]`* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/pricing)

<span style="display: none">
- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-fees)
</span>

Integrating these digital payment platforms allows Chopin to **verify the transactions in realtime and post the result** to [order google sheet](https://apiobuild.com/blog/how-to-create-web-store-with-apio/#step-3-add-order-google-sheet), so you don't have to manually confirm each payment or check the amount totals.

#### Manual Options

We also support some popular manual payment options across North America. However, manual payment means that the transaction will be handled outside of the Chopin checkout. We won't be able to verify these payments either, though the payment method selected by customers will still be posted to your [order google sheet](https://apiobuild.com/blog/how-to-create-web-store-with-apio/#step-3-add-order-google-sheet).

- *`[NEW]`* [PayPal.Me](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/): Provide your PayPal.Me link. It will look like: https://www.paypal.me/youraccount This is the only manual payment which we can auto-generate the order total amount for customers. Recommended over other manual options.
  [*How to set up PayPal.Me?](https://apiobuild.com/blog/troubleshoot-chopin-store/#how-to-set-up-paypal-me)
- [Zelle](https://www.zellepay.com/): Provide your Zelle email or mobile number.
- [Venmo](https://venmo.com/): Provide your Venmo handle.
- [E-transfer](https://www.interac.ca/en/consumers/products/interac-e-transfer/): Provide your E-Transfer email or mobile number.
- Pay at Pick-Up: Check this box if you wish to collect payment when customers pick up their orders.
- *`[NEW]`* Collect on Delivery: Check this box if you or courier will collect payment when the order is delivered to customers.

### Shipping

- Shipping Option: You can setup multiple options and the coresponding shipping cost. It will appear as a dropdown menu. You can also use this section to set pick-up dates/locations.
- Free Shipping: Set a free shipping amount.
- Delivery Zipcode: We can validate customers' addresses based on a list or lists of zipcodes provided, so you don't have to worry out-of-zone delivery. Use commas (,) to separate zipcodes. 
   *Note: We currently only support US addresses.*

<img src="/images/blog/f_shipping.png" class="post-img">

### Discount

- Discount Type: You can set up a dollar value discount or a percentage discount.
- Discount Category: Enter a category, if you wish apply discount only to this category.
- Discount Threshold: Enter a dollar value, if you wish to apply discount only to order over this amount.

<img src="/images/blog/g_discount.png" class="post-img">

### Tax

Enter the tax rate in your area. If you set Tax Rate as 0, tax option will not be shown on your online store.

If you have certain products that don't apply to sales tax, you can indicate that in the `no_tax` field in your [Catalog Google Sheet](#update-catalog-sheet).

### Waitress API

These are auto-generated when you created the store. If you need to update them, <a href="mailto:apiobuild@gmail.com">contact us</a>.

We use apio\'s own [Waitress google sheet API](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/waitress) as catalog and order APIs. We welcome you to bring your own API, <a href="mailto:apiobuild@gmail.com">let us know</a>!
