# The Challenges

Collecting emails from website visitors is one crucial way to grow your audience, whether you’re looking to convert subscribers to customers or to directly communicate to your users. 


## 1. It can be complicated to set up a sign-up form.

It often requires multiple steps to collect emails from your website: 

1. Research an email marketing service that offers a free tier and register the service.
2. Design a sign-up form on that service.
3. Figure out how to embed the form to your website:
   - If using a website builder (WordPress, SquareSpace, Wix, etc.), see if the marketing tool provides a plug-in for easy integration.
   - If building your own website, spend some time to find where the embedded code located.
4. If the sign-up form option is not provided by the selected email marketing tool, find a plug-in compatible with your website builder.

**Sometimes, you just need a simple tool to help you build the email list that doesn’t require multiple steps to implement and countless research for free solutions.**



## 2. You (perhaps) don’t need all those fancy features.

As a small business owner or blogger who just started out, you might not need the full capacity of all the features those email marketing services offer. *(Yes, we agree that A/B testing is important, but do you need it when you only have 100 contacts?)*

*[insert illustration question marks with some terms: A/B Testing, Behavior-based Automation,*

In order to focus on perfecting your product or service, you might not want to put too many resources and efforts to figure out how everything works or how it works on your website. **At this beginning phase, we recognize that you simply want/need to send updates to about your new projects or special discounts.**



# The Solution

Especially you get to use the interface that everyone is already familiar with - Google Sheet - to update information. And you still have all the functionality to process your data: sort, filter, delete duplicate, find, etc..
