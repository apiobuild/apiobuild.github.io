## Step 1: Create a Store

Go to [Telescope (apio microservices platform)](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/). Log in with your existing google account by selecting `Sign in with Google` in the pop-up window.

Then go to [Chopin Stores](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/flow/chopin-stores) to start creating your store. First step is naming your store. Store name cannot be changed later.

## Step 2: Add Catalog Google Sheet

You will need two google sheets (one served as **product catalog**, another one for **collecting order**). Follow the direction to create a new google sheet as your catalog, where you input product details and prices.

1. Create Sheet: Click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> (plus sign) to create a google sheet, that will be used as catalog.
2. Populate Data: Click <i class="fas fa-copy"></i> (copy sign) to copy the example data, then paste it to your sheet.
3. Share: Click the email address to copy it. Go to your google sheet, the click `Share` at the top right corner. Add the copied email address as Editor.
4. Authorize: Copy this google sheet URL and paste it in the Google Sheet URL field. Then click <i class="fas fa-unlock"></i> (unlock sign) to authorize. After authorization, only you can access your sheet through our API.

*You can replace example data with your own later. See this [article](https://apiobuild.com/blog/how-to-configure-chopin-store/) for more information.*

## Step 3: Add Order Google Sheet

Repeat the same process to create another google sheet, which will be storing **new orders** that customers submit to your store. 

1. Create Sheet: Click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> (plus sign) to create another google sheet, that will be used to collect order.
2. Populate Data: Click <i class="fas fa-copy"></i> (copy sign) to copy the header columns, then paste it to your sheet.
3. Share: Click the email address to copy it. Go to your google sheet, the click `Share` at the top right corner. Add the copied email address as Editor. 
4. Authorize: Copy this google sheet URL and paste it in the Google Sheet URL field. Then click <i class="fas fa-unlock"></i> (unlock sign) to authorize.

You can manage this order sheet in your preferred way by adjusting the order of columns or adding more columns (i.e. order_shipped, order_completed, note, etc).
