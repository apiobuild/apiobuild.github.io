SEO is one of those trendy words that every website developer lists on their offerings. Many people come to us and ask if our website can do SEO. **In this article, let us breakdown this fancy word and discuss [how apio creates SEO-friendly websites](#chopin-s-seo-features).** Our honest answer? No, building a website does not give you SEO.

## TL; DR

> **SEO is driven by content! Website developers give you a framework to publish content not the content itself.** 

Owner has to create great content to optimize SEO. [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) (or any other website builders) does not give you "SEO", the content you publish on wordpress gives you SEO. Why would you ask a web developer/design agency to do this - go to marketing consultancy.

## What is SEO?

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is using organic traffic generation by the website‚Äôs content (blog articles) to make business or brand to be visible for searchers on search engines (like [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/)). Google did not reveal how exactly their algorithms determine where to position your website in the search results, but there are some factors that will improve your search result ranking:

 - [Relevancy](#relevancy): **How much is your content related to the keyword?** When people search "custom cake delivery in New York", they will not find a realtor's website.

 - [Authority](#authority): **How many people find your content credible?** When more people link your page to their sites, Google think your website is authoritative. 

 - [Usefulness](#usefulness): **Is your content easy to understand so people can actually utilize that information?** You rarely find academic thesis in your search results, even when you search some technical terms. If you can't understand the content, then that's not useful for you.

## Developer vs. Marketer 

So, how can developers help you to achieve SEO? Where do marketing specialists come in?

Developers should build you a **SEO-friendly website framework** that helps search engine spiders find and index all of the pages on your website. Marketers should help you identify keywords and polish the content that can drive traffic to your website.

#### Relevancy

üíª Developer builds a website framework that **indexes your site** properly so search engines can read the content and eventually determine if that's relevant to the search.

üìä Marketer conducts keyword reseach and helps you **identify popular or niche keyphrases**.

#### Authority 

üíª Developer makes sure your website content is **linkable**.

üìä Marketerg **generates trustworthy contents** that other sites would link to. For example, if you write a detailed article to explain the difference between baking soda and baking powder, it's likely that baking blogger would link your page as a reference.

#### Usefulness

üíª Developer sets up a **simple and flat website architecture** so users can find information easily and in less than 4 clicks. 

üìä Marketer **develops relatable contents** that people can actually understand. Sometimes copywriters help you to revise technical jargons and rephrase in your target audience's language.

## But, do you really need SEO?

Beyond those built-in features powered by Chopin, what else you need to do for SEO? SEO is for driving steady traffic to your website. If you are a lifestyle blogger making referrals to amazon products, yes, you want SEO. If you are a small restaurant or local business owner, there's no value (nor reason) having someone come to read your website every other day. 

**Honestly, we've found SEO performs way poorer comparing to outreaching directly on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/).**

If your website is for generating sales/leads at a smaller scale and your keyword space is extremely competitive (example: creating a free website, best bakery in NYC), you can forget about SEO unless you come with a big budget to outbid other websites' rank.

If you simply want brand awareness and visibility, go do marketing and reach out. Grow organically with referrals or buy ads. **You can use website as a way for SEO only if you are committed to create contents** Otherwise, website is nothing more than a functional interface to communicate with your customers.

#### ATM, an example 

Giving a more vivid example, would you think of ATM access as bank's marketing strategy? No, retail banks put ATM out so they can help you everywhere 24/7. The customers would want to stick with that bank because it's convenient to do business with them via ATM not because they saw an ATM. Do banks care if you go to their branch every other day? No, they only want you to visit when you have a problem otherwise it's a line of cost. For most businesses out there, website is 95% ATM and 5% flyer.

## Summary

**At apio, we take care all the website mechanics (in this case, also some SEO tactics), so business owners can focus on what they're good at - sell and develop products.** We hope this article clarifies some myths about SEO and you will not ask web developer if they can do SEO from now on.

Happy marketing!üí∞
