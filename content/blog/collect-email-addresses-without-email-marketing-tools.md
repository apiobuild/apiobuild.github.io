Email sign-ups from website visitors is one of the most crucial ways to grow your audience, whether youâ€™re looking to convert subscribers to customers or to directly communicate to your clients. In this post we'll show you how to setup easy email sign-up form for free on your website.

We built this service after looking into other email marketing platforms (<a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>, <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/" target="_blank">Constant Contacts</a>, <a href="https://www.omnisend.com/" target="_blank">OmniSend</a>, etc.), comparing their services, plans, and going through those articles titled <a href="https://themeisle.com/blog/best-free-email-marketing-services/" target="_blank">"Five Best Free Email Marketing Services"</a>.

We've found a simple email sign-up form is actually ... quite complicated - but it doesn't have to be.

## Existing Email List Services Are Complicated

It often requires multiple steps to collect emails from your website:

1. Research an email marketing tool that fits your needs and budget
2. Design a sign-up form
3. Get the embedded code and configure it with your website builder

## Starting Simple

As small business owner or influencer who's just testing the water, you might not need the full capacity of all the features those email marketing services offer. *(Yes, A/B testing is important, but do you need it when you only have 1000 contacts?)*

**At this beginning phase, we recognize that you simply want/need to send updates to about your new projects or special discounts.**
