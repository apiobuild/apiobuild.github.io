Not many small businesses care at all about technology at the beginning (unless it's a software or tech startup). For the average small businesses, whether it's a hair salon, coffee shop, or artisan bakery, most people start by creating the perfect products (coffee, cakes). Have you ever wondered, how do the chain stores keep the price low while keeping the customers happy? Meanwhile, local businesses, though they work as hard as they could, still cannot compete with chain stores.

## Scale can keep the cost low

Obviously, chain stores have scale to keep the cost low. Scale comes with many benefits, it means fixed costs can be shared across the businesses. [Economies of scale has a very theoretical definition.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale) Breaking down into simple terms, industrial oven is more expensive than home oven, however, it's able to bake more cakes. The more you bake, the cheaper each cake would be.

The same principal applies to different aspects of business and technology is no exception. The bigger the business is, the lower the cost could be. To be clear, cheaper product is not always better, however, as a business, given similar products, lower cost is almost always an advantage. The cost come in many different forms, it's not just the cost of raw materials, it's also how much time and energy business owners spend on building and maintaining the business.

## Just buy a giant oven

You might be thinking, one couldn't possibly buy a giant oven to bake cheaper cakes. Just because each cake is cheaper doesn't mean you could sell that many cakes. Increasing the supply to keep the unit cost down only works if the demand meets the supply. [There\'s, again, a very theoretical explanation that profit maximizes when MR=MC.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_revenue)

## Sharing costs with other businesses

While there are costs that's not easily sharable, technology has made it possible to share costs with other small businesses on other things. This is exactly the reason we've created apio platform. The fact that every small business needs slightly different but similar technology solutions, we believe it's possible to find common denominators to create simple yet flexible tools for most small businesses.

## No more custom software

It's extremely difficult to build custom software. We've seen over and over that small businesses hire one-off developers or consultants to build their websites and ended up either unable to maintain or impossible to extend functionalities. Bigger companies avoid these problems by building strong in-house technology team that is simply impossible for small businesses to afford. Consultants or agencies might not be as motivated to say this - it's possible to have high quality software that does not cost a fortune, that's usable and extendable longer term. We do this by building the tech platform for **ALL** small businesses. If grocery in every corner around the world join forces, we could build a tech platform that is just as good as Amazon for everyone - except, we are not Amazon, we think the authenticity and human interaction is the most unique part of any small business, we strive to build great softwares for every business, however different they are.

## Last word

We believe in empowerment to creative and innovative small business owners. The advancement of technology platforms has on one hand make entrepreneurship much more prevalent than ever. Platforms like youtube, facebook, twitter and many more make building audience and businesses easier than ever. At the same time, in order to maximize platform's own interest, it has also impose unnecessary restrictions and added complexity for its own customers. We'd like to propose a different future for platform technology: empower entrepreneurs to build with full freedom with a completely different business model yet still enjoy the benefits of shared cost with technology platform.
