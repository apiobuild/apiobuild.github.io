## Current Solutions for Online Store

When creating online stores, you have a couple of choices:
- List items on marketplace platforms (<a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank">eBay</a>)
- Use an eCommerce website builder (<a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a>, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/" target="_blank">BigCommerce</a>, <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a>)
- Build your own eCommerce website with open-source (<a href="https://www.opencart.com/" target="_blank">OpenCart</a>)


**Orrrrrrrrrrr** There's a free and easy way we created - <a href="#chopin">Learn how Chopin generates online stores for FREE with only a few clicks and google sheets now.</a>

#### Online Marketplace: Customers Can‚Äôt Find You

This is probably the cheapest way to go into the world of eCommerce. You might already have the experience selling second-hand items on eBay, Craiglist, or Facebook Marketplace and are familiar with the interface. At sites like Etsy, there are other sellers and customers who share the same market/interest with you. **However, it‚Äôs hard to stand out from your competitors.** 

While product names with very long names can be beneficial for the search algorithm, they are too complicated to be easily scanned and understood by the customer.

#### Website Builder: Seems Easy but Intimidating

There are just too many online store builders you can choose from. While the basic plan can be as low as $18 per month, these costs can add up and increase as your business grows due to scalable pricing. You‚Äôre already paying a lot of startup costs: web-hosting, domain name, email marketing, **why add more monthly fees to your overhead?**

To better serve different business models and needs, these services strive for developing as many features as possible. **The options available on the settings page and the enormous plug-ins sometimes can be quite intimidating to a new user.**

#### Chopin: Enjoy both the Simplicity and Ultimate Freedom

While our out-of-box option allows you to set up your store with only a couple of clicks. All templating options are available for you to customize by uploading html block. Let us take care of the security, deployment, monitoring so you can focus on the most important components that helps you grow your business - content and marketing.

Chopin made creating your own store as easy as filling out a simple survey. You only need to provide your **logo and store information** as well as **google sheets** with the catalog and order data respectively, then **your shopping site will be generated.**
