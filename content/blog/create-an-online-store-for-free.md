- Use an eCommerce website builder ([Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/), [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/), [Wix](https://www.wix.com/))
- Build your own eCommerce website with open-source ([OpenCart](https://www.opencart.com/))

**Or** ..................

- We've created a free and easy way - [Chopin](#introducing-chopin). Learn how Chopin generates online stores for FREE with only a few clicks and google sheets now.

#### Online Marketplace: Customers Can‚Äôt Find You

This is probably the cheapest way to start your online business. You might already have the experience selling second-hand items on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/), [Craigslist](https://newyork.craigslist.org/), or [Facebook Marketplace](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/) and are familiar with the interface. At sites like [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), there are other sellers and customers who share the same market/interest with you. **However, it‚Äôs hard to stand out from your competitors.**

#### Website Builder: All the Customization You Don't Need

There are just too many online store builders you can choose from. While the basic plan can be as low as $18 per month, these costs can add up and increase as your business grows due to scalable pricing. You‚Äôre already paying a lot of startup costs: web-hosting, domain name, email marketing, **why add more monthly fees to your overhead?**

To better serve different business models and needs, these services strive for developing as many features as possible. **The options available on the settings page and the enormous plug-ins sometimes can be quite intimidating to a new user.**

#### Chopin: Enjoy both the Simplicity and Ultimate Freedom

While our out-of-box option allows you to set up your store with only a couple of clicks, all templating options are available for you to customize by uploading html block. Let us take care of the security, deployment, monitoring so you can focus on the most important components that helps you grow your business - content and marketing.

## Introducing Chopin

It‚Äôs hard to decide which approach suits you best, and there are many pros and cons. Why waste time on researching which platform to sell when you could've started selling your product already!

**[Chopin by apio](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/chopin) is a lightweight static online store generator.** After providing store information (name, logo), catalog (item/service description and price), and order form through API, it will generate a static website with a unique url.

#### Demo

In the [demo store](https://trampoline.apiobuild.com/router/chopin/store/page/google-oauth2%7C117090713962028193035/7a8c0376-0fd0-4093-894f-e6d0200444d4), we've configured one google sheet to be catalog and another one to store order:

<video width="100%" loop="true" autoplay="true" controls style="align: center">
<source src="/video/chopin-quick-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

You can easily update products to the catalog on google sheet and the store will update in real-time. On the other side, when user submits an order, you will immediately see google sheet updated with order details. [Check out the store yourself now](https://trampoline.apiobuild.com/router/chopin/store/page/google-oauth2%7C117090713962028193035/7a8c0376-0fd0-4093-894f-e6d0200444d4).

## Benefits

#### Easy to Set Up

Chopin made creating your own store as easy as filling out a simple survey. You only need to provide your **logo and store information** as well as **google sheets** with the catalog and order data respectively, then **your shopping site will be generated.**

To save even more of your time and energy, you can simply let [Waitress](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/waitress) (our lightweight API to use Google Sheet as a data store for backend applications) extract catalog data from your google sheets.

#### Responsive Design

As much as we want to provide great user experiences for store owners, we also want your customers to have a smooth experience when browsing the merchandise. Chopin‚Äôs website design can accommodate different settings on a variety of devices and screen sizes. **Your customers will be able to place orders on their phones, tablets, or laptops.** You also save energy by not having to develop and test different designs on various devices.

#### Free and Flexible

At [apio](https://apiobuild.com/), we believe that good technology should be accessible and shareable. **Chopin is a FREE solution for small business owners.** We operate on revenue from ads that appeared on your store. If you‚Äôre looking for an ad-free store, [feel free contact us for pricing plan](https://apiobuild.com/forms/business/).

We also welcome third-party integrations and don‚Äôt want to tie you down with only the services we offer. While we offer various microservices and APIs through [Telescope](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/), we‚Äôre more than happy to help you integrate other APIs to your store based on your use cases.

#### Simple yet Secured

**All Chopin generated sites are SSL certified and meet the highest security standard**, which means your customers‚Äô sensitive data (email addresses, phone number, names etc.) are encrypted and protected from unauthorized users. This feature doesn‚Äôt just protect store owners and their customers, is also the required element for implementing third-party payment gateways (i.e. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [Square](https://squareup.com/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/)).
