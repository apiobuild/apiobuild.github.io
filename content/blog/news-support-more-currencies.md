## Local Currency

Chopin store's default currency is USD ($). **Now you can sell your products in your local currency.** In addition to change the symbol of the currency unit on website and in [confirmation emails](https://apiobuild.com/blog/introducing-post-it-email-automation-service/#use-case-automated-order-confirmation), the  currency unit will also be reflected on your integrated [payment methods](https://apiobuild.com/blog/how-to-configure-chopin-store/#payment-methods).

### Key to Appeal Local Consumers

Doesn't matter where you operate your business from, you need to localize your e-commerce website and create a shopping experience that appeals to customers in that targeted region.

A clear majority (more than 70% of shoppers in Australia, UK, and Canada) prefers to
make purchases from local
websites. While they might find products on a USD-only website, these consumers search
similar products on an alternative,
locally priced website to make
their purchase. *[â€”Local Currency Pricing for E-Commerce, Penton Research and E4X](https://www.cambridgefx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/E4X-Local-Currency-Pricing-06-07-20161.pdf)*

Seeing products in their own currency helps customers to understand the pricing and know what to expect during the payment process. With Chopin's ability to display products in various languages, currency localization helps you to reach customers in your region. Start locally pricing our products today!

**Pre-Sale**

Everything from website to social media constitutes your messaging to your audience. You have to create consistent contents along with clear product/service information in order to build the trust between you and customers. So they feel the confidence to make a purchase and expect delivery later.

When it comes to social media marketing, many people immediately think of Facebook Page, Group, or Instagram. In fact, [Twitter can be a powerful marketing tool for your business too](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/25110/5-steps-to-using-twitter-for-ecommerce-marketing.aspx), given it's optimized for contant and mutual engagement with your followers. Frequent posting is not considered spamming and retweet/mention/respond are always very welcomed.

**Post-Sale**

After paying for the products, customers might have questions relate to shipping timeline, how to use the product, or even how to buy add-ons.

Doing the customer service  right can help you develop repeating customers. You need to make multiple communication tools available so the customers can choose the format they are most accustomed to using. Some clients might like to talk to real person and obtain instand response, while some people prefer to use email to avoid waiting time.

Let's take this scenario to global comparison.  WhatsApp is an instant messaging app that is extremely popular in India and Brazil, while SMS (aka texting) is still favored by people in the U.S., where texting fee is included in most mobile plans.
