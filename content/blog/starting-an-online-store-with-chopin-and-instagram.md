The first step to start an online business is to create a website. This involves getting a domain, hiring developers, creating contents and more. That‚Äôs a lot of work and investment before you can even put your products online. Many small business owners turn to social media (mostly [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/)) to build up their brand. It‚Äôs free, easy, and most people √•re already familiar with these platforms. **Our online store creator [Chopin](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/chopin) shares these benefits and can join forces with Instagram to help you create an online store with your Instagram posts.**

## Atelier EHOI

[Atelier EHOI](https://tinyurl.com/Atelier-EHOI) is a boutique bakery in the New York/New Jersey area. They already established presence on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/atelierehoi-115683523541293/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/atelierehoi/). Prior to using Chopin, they were collecting orders through google form which makes the transition painless, as they are already familiar with google products.

#### Google Sheet and Instagram

With Chopin, all product information including name, price, description, image, etc. is stored in a google sheet. **Atelier EHOI is able to extract URLs from their previous images and posts on Instagram, and use them as product links and images on their Chopin site.** This way, they save time and energy by re-purposing the social content created already and don‚Äôt have to craft new content for the online store.

#### Real-Time Update

Atelier EHOI features a weekly updated Dacquoise menu. They announce the secret flavors one week prior to the order deadline. **With Chopin, they can update the cake flavor every week by simply updating a few cells in google sheet.** It not only streamlined the menu update process for store owners, it also made it easier for customers to explore their weekly menu.

#### Announcement

During summer, Atelier EHOI runs a special campaign with a 40% discount. They are able to inform customers with price deduction at the top of their website to boost online sales.

## Summary

Atelier EHOI is a perfect example of how simple tool integration can smooth online business operations. The onboarding process took only a couple days. There's no need to learn a monstrous platform or different tools and can plug in Instagram contents to start an online store.
