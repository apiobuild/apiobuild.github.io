## Tutorial

The catalog google sheet for multi-option products is just same as the catalog google sheet used in the basic Chopin store, but with some more columns. 

<div class="row py-2">
  <div class="table-box table-warning table-responsive px-2 py-2">
    <table class="center">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="wide">option:size</td>
          <td class="wide">option:flavor</td>
          <td class="wide">option:color</td>
          <td class="wide">option:name</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
</div>

### Step 1: Choose Option Methods

There are three different ways to present your options and you can choose up to 2 options:

|             | `option-size`                                                | `option-flavor` | `option-color`  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- |
| Appearance  | Rectanglur Boxes                                             | Drop-Down Menu  | Color Circles   |
| Field Value | Custom Text                                                  | Custom Text     | HTML Color Name |
|             | <img src="/images/blog/option-size.png" class="post-img"> | <img src="/images/blog/option-flavor.png" class="post-img">|<img src="/images/blog/option-color.png" class="post-img">| 

{{< rawhtml >}}
<style>
  table{
    width: 100%;
    text-align: center;
  }
  thead>tr {
    height: 50px;
  }
  tbody>tr{
    height: 40px;
  }
</style>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

#### option:size

This field doesn't have to be **sizes** (S, M, L or 5.5, 6, 6.5), it can also be different **styles**. The text you put in to the cell will appear below the product image in the **squared box**.

`option:size` can be in any languages other than English, but cannot contain spaces. Dashes (-) is fine.

#### option:flavor

Same as above, this field doesn't have to be **flavors**. The text you put in to the cell will appear below the product image as **drop-down menu**.

`option:flavor` can be in anylanguages other than English, but cannot contain spaces. Dashes (-) is fine.

#### option:color

There are two ways to indicate your product color, which will apprear in **circle**.

1. Color Name: Just enter a color (i.e. red, blue, black, etc.). You can refer to [this list](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) to find names for specific colors (i.e. lightskyblue, olive, and more).

2. Hex Code: Enter the 6-digit code with # sign. For example, #556B2F for olive.

### Step 2: Group Same Products Together

You also need one additional field to indicate which products should be grouped together.

#### option:name

Group the same kind of products together by inputing the same value in this field. For example, a sun dress comes with two colors - white and yellow. The `option:name` fields for these two rows have to be the same, which are `dress`, so the system can identify these *two products* are actually *two options of the same product*.

*Remember to follow the same rule of `name` field - unique name/id contains only dashes, underscores, and alphanumeric. No space is allowed.*

## Example: A Clothing Store

Now you understand what these new columns mean, let us show you how to set up a product with multiple options. 

For example, I'd like to sell this wool coat that comes with two *colors* (pink, blue) and three *sizes* (S, M, L) for each color. I will need to create 6 rows of products (2 * 3 = 6):

- Pink Coat in S size
- Pink Coat in M size
- Pink Coat in L size
- Blue Coat in S size
- Blue Coat in M size
- Blue Coat in L size

#### name

All these products should have a unique `name` a.k.a product id, so I decided to follow this naming guide: `coat-<color>-<size>`. Feel free to use sku numbers.

*Reminder: `name` has to be unique value, which means no products can share the same `name`.*

<img src="/images/blog/step-1-name.png" class="post-img">

#### nickname

I want the product title changes to the coresponding color, when customer tap different color options. So I put "Wool Coat Pink" in the `nickname` field for all sizes of pink coats, and "Wool Coat Blue" for all sizes of blue coats.

<img src="/images/blog/step-2-nickname.png" class="post-img">

#### option:size

There are three sizes available for each color, so I just input "S, M, L" for the `option:size` field of all pink coat rows. Repeat the same process for blue coats.

<img src="/images/blog/step-3-size.png" class="post-img">

#### option:color

I refer to [this color name list](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) and think "pink" and "powderblue" represent the pink and blue coats perfectly. So I input "powderblue" in the `option:color` field for all blue coats and "pink" for all pink coats respectively.

<img src="/images/blog/step-4-color.png" class="post-img">

#### option:name

In order to indicate these six rows of product are actually one product with six options. I put "coat" in the `option:name` field for all the coats.

<img src="/images/blog/step-5-name.png" class="post-img">

#### Other Fields

Finally, continue to finish the other fields (`description`, `product_url`, `image_url`, `price`, `max_qty`, `category`). You can keep them all the same or customize for each option depending on whether each option has varied description, image, price, etc.

üõçÔ∏è [What does these fields mean?](https://apiobuild.com/blog/how-to-configure-chopin-store/#update-catalog-sheet)

Now you can showcase different style and sizing for this wool coat!

*Note: Given the product layouts for single option and multiple options look a little different, we suggest you organize all single-option products together and vice versa.*

### Check Your Google Sheet Data

- `name`: there should not be any duplicate value. All `name` cells must be unique even when they share the same `option:name`.
- `option:size` and `option:flavor`: these cells should not contain spaces.
