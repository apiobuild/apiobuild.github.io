You can do so much with this simple website in additional to making it as your official website, including a landing page to collect subscribers, a digital flyer with latest promotion and product catalog, or [an event program](https://trampoline.apiobuild.com/router/goldfish/about/page/google-oauth2%7C114718484900223642230/348db9c7-00df-4763-904b-2710de1e4090) listed with agenda and speakers.

## Step 2: Add Basic Information

Firstly, let's add some basic information of this website - including what this page is about, how to contact the page owner, brand logo and color, etc.

### Page Info and Design

- Page Title: The title of your website.
- Page Subtitle *(optional)*: A subtitle.
- Page Logo: Give your store a logo in URL format. Your logo will also be shown in the website footer and used as preview thumbnail when sharing on social media.
[*What\'s image URL?](https://apiobuild.com/blog/troubleshoot-chopin-store/#how-can-i-obtain-image-url)
- Header Color: This is essentially the theme color of this website, which will also apply to the font color of the top row text and the "go to top" button. You can easily select color from swatch or enter a [hex code](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).

### Contact Information

- Email: Email address to reach you. (eg. apiobuild@gmail.com)
- Facebook: Full url to your facebook page or group. (eg. https://www.facebook.com/apiobuild)
- Instagram: Full url to your Instagram page.  (eg. https://www.instagram.com/apiobuild/)
- Line: Url to your line account or line group. [*How to retrive LINE URL?](https://www.pkstep.com/archives/5261)
- Phone Number: Start with country code (US: +1) and without dash nor brackets (eg. +17181234567)

Click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> (plus sign) to add new contact information. If you'd like to modify it, just select the same contact method and enter with the updated information. Then click <i class="fas fa-plus"></i> (plus sign) to update. You can also click <i class="fas fa-minus"></i> (minus sign) to delete the information.

### Hero Image

Hero image is the first thing people see when they first enter your site. Here are some great ways to give your first impression. A [ambience photography](https://unsplash.com/photos/ItaV89TNkks) can set the tone for your brand, a showcase of some of your [proudest works](https://unsplash.com/photos/I2RnOO8ojQ4) definitely draw people's eye, or a team photo that gives viewers a more intimate look into your business. Sometimes, a [simple slogan](https://unsplash.com/photos/oqStl2L5oxI) or a direct call to action (i.e. "Shop Now") create a dialogue with your audience and encourage the them to respond. Be creative and adventurous with your choice of hero image!

Goldfish creates responsive website, so the hero image displays differently depending on the screen size of your viewing device. Therefore, **we recommend you to keep important information center**, if you plan to add text to your image. Swapping image in Goldfish is as easy as pasting a different URL, so the trial and error won't be too troublesome.

- Hero Image URL: The ideal hero image should be **landscape** in size larger than 1024 x 500 px.
- Mobile Image URL *(optional)*: You can have a different image or the same image in different orientation for a better mobile viewing experience. The ideal image should be **portrait** or **square**.

## Step 3: Contribute Content

The next step will be telling your story!

**Select Layout:** We have designed a variety of layouts for you to choose how you'd like to present your contents (currently 6 options). Don't mind how we call these sections, just focus on the formats and choose the ones that fit you needs.
